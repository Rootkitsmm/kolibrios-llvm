kolibrios-llvm
==============

Kolibrios-llvm is a fork of [KolibriOS project](http://kolibrios.org/) ported to LLVM.

LLVM is a tiny operating system with monolyth core mostly written in x86 asm, so it's not so portable as it would be. Now it's time to change the situation!

The main goal of a project is to provide a good portability for currently absolutely nonportable Kolibri OS by translating all the x86 asm source code to a LLVM bitcode.

Let's giveKolibri some real future.

You can contrinubute the project very simply â€” it's on the very beginning of the project's path so all the neccessary questions are on a talk now. YouPlease feel free creating issues, talking & supplementing the code. 

May the force be with it lol.
